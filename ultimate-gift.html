        <p>There are moments in life when things line up a little too neatly. Not in the cheesy movie way, where background music swells and everyone hugs in slow motion. I mean the subtle ones. The ones you can explain away if you really want to. The ones you'd miss entirely if you blink, or shrug, or chalk it up to coincidence because it feels safer than believing something bigger is at work.</p>

        <p>I've spent most of my life doing exactly that. Shrugging. Moving on. Keeping things "rational." I'm a Gen-X kid, after all. We were raised on Nintendo, bad school lunches, and the fine art of pretending things don't bother us. But the older I get, the harder it is to ignore the way certain moments hum. Not loudly. Quietly. Like they're waiting on you to notice.</p>

        <p>I didn't expect one of those moments to show up the same day I sent my final manuscript to my book designer. Actually hitting "submit" was its own miracle. I'd carried these stories my whole life. Some funny, some painful, some buried so deep I wasn't sure I had the right to dig them up again. But I did. And it felt like stepping into sunlight after years of looking the other way.</p>

        <p>Later that afternoon, my phone buzzed. It was a text from my dad.</p>

        <p>Now, let me stop here. My dad had no idea I'd written a book. Not a clue. Not one whisper. I'd purposely kept it quiet because… well, because I'm me. I don't like the spotlight. I don't like being fussed over. And I sure wasn't going to announce I'd written a memoir and then have to explain why, or what it meant, or any of the reasons behind it.</p>

        <p>So this text comes in out of the blue. Dad sends me a link and says, "You and Ivy should watch this movie. It's called The Ultimate Gift."</p>

        <p>No context. No reason. No "hey, saw this and thought of you." Just a title and a nudge.</p>

        <p>I figured it was another one of those Kirk Cameron Christian movies and he didn't want to leave me behind. But he had never mentioned this one before. And the timing felt strange. Could've ignored it. Instead, I opened YouTube, found the movie, and hit play.</p>

        <p>That decision changed something in me.</p>

        <p>If you've never seen <em>The Ultimate Gift</em>, it's about a spoiled young man whose billionaire grandfather dies and leaves him not money, but a series of challenges—Life Lessons if you will. Thirteen of them. Each one a "gift" disguised as a lesson. The Gift of Work. The Gift of Friends. The Gift of Gratitude. The Gift of Love. And eventually, The Ultimate Gift itself: the meaning of life.</p>

        <p>You would think the writers had broken into my house, stolen a copy of my book, and reverse-engineered it into a screenplay.</p>

        <p>I sat there on the couch, staring at the screen in this weird mix of awe and confusion. Because scene after scene, lesson after lesson, I kept seeing pieces of my own book. Not just general themes, but oddly specific parallels to the stories I'd lived and the things I'd been writing about for months.</p>

        <p>Work. Friendship. Pain. Gratitude. Family. Love. Legacy.</p>

        <p>Every one of those is stitched into <em>Life Lessons of a Man-Child</em>. Not because I copied them from some movie. But because those were the lessons I learned the hard way, growing up with a Marine father, a mother losing her memory, brothers I adored, a grandmother who walked in miracles, and a childhood that shaped me into something both tender and stubborn.</p>

        <p>Watching it, something inside me whispered, "Pay attention. Observe and Reflect!"</p>

        <p>That whisper wasn't coming from sentimentality. Or nostalgia. Or the small hope that my book wasn't a colossal mistake. It felt older. Deeper. Familiar in a way I didn't want to admit.</p>

        <p>And then it hit me.</p>

        <p>What were the odds that my dad—my quiet, stubborn, old-school Marine father—would recommend that movie on the precise day I delivered my finished manuscript? Not a week after. Not two months before. That exact day.</p>

        <p>At first, I tried to shrug it off. Maybe he just stumbled across it. Maybe it was kismet. Maybe he watched it years ago and forgot. But the harder I tried to rationalize it, the more it felt like one of those moments you're not supposed to brush off. Like God tapping you on the shoulder after watching <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> saying, "This means something."</p>

        <p>My whole book is about paying attention to life. Seeing things for what they really are. Not running from your past. Not pretending you weren't shaped by the things you lived through. And certainly not ignoring the quiet ways God threads meaning into the fabric of our days.</p>

        <p>Yet here I was, seeing meaning staring me in the face, and trying to explain it away.</p>

        <p>We do that, don't we? We tell ourselves miracles only happen to other people. That revelations are for saints and prophets and people who speak softly with their hands folded. Not for Gen-X kids from Arkansas who played Atari and learned the hard way that life is messy, family is complicated, and growing up is optional.</p>

        <p>But maybe that's the whole point. God doesn't always crash into your life with fire from heaven. Sometimes He just sends your dad a random movie recommendation.</p>

        <p>Sometimes He arranges things so perfectly that the only thing that makes sense is that something bigger is at work.</p>

        <p>So I sat there watching this kid in the movie learn lesson after lesson after lesson, and it felt like I was watching my own life in a funhouse reflection. Warped, exaggerated, but still undeniably mine.</p>

        <p>I saw the stubborn kid version of me learning work ethic from a father who never quit anything.</p>

        <p>I saw the bullied kid version of me finding strength through imagination and Star Wars.</p>

        <p>I saw the young man losing people he loved and trying to make sense of grief.</p>

        <p>I saw the adult man who almost lost faith, then slowly found his way back.</p>

        <p>I saw friendships earned, mistakes owned, forgiveness given.</p>

        <p>I saw the moments where God stepped in, even when I didn't recognize Him.</p>

        <p>And it dawned on me that maybe my book wasn't just a collection of stories after all. Maybe it was its own kind of gift. Not in the way the movie presents it—wrapped in wealth, guarded by lawyers, delivered through complicated tests—but in the way truth is a gift. In the way honesty is a gift. In the way telling your story out loud, without shame or filters, is a gift.</p>

        <p>A gift to myself, sure. But maybe a gift to someone else too. Someone who needed to know that we are not alone. Someone who needed to know that you can get knocked down by life and still find something worth holding on to.</p>

        <p>In <em>The Ultimate Gift</em>, the biggest lie the main character believes is that life is all about him. That everything he wants, he deserves. That pain is punishment instead of refinement. That gratitude is optional. That love is a transaction.</p>

        <p>He gets stripped down until all he has left is himself. And then he realizes that was never the point. Life was always bigger than him.</p>

        <p>That's a lesson I've had to learn too. The hard way. Through mistakes. Through loss. Through waking up one day and realizing the faith I'd drifted away from was the same faith still calling me back.</p>

        <p>There's a scene near the end of the movie where the main character finally understands what his grandfather was trying to teach him: that the ultimate gift wasn't money or comfort or success. It was clarity. Purpose. A changed heart.</p>

        <p>That scene hit me harder than I expected. Not because it was emotional, but because I felt like I was being reminded of something I should have known all along. That the point of writing my book, telling my story, was never just to tell it. It was to see it. To understand it. To honor the people who made me who I am. And maybe, if I'm lucky, to help someone else start seeing their own story differently.</p>

        <p>When the credits rolled, I sat there thinking about my dad. He had no idea I'd finished my book that day. No idea what I'd written. No idea that his simple movie suggestion would feel like God smiling at me and saying, "Nice work, son. You listened."</p>

        <p>Maybe Dad didn't plan it. Maybe he didn't realize the significance. But something in me knows that timing wasn't random.</p>

        <p>I've had these moments before. My Mimaw's one-ring pact fulfilled after she passed. The bone-deep feeling that certain memories aren't just memories. The moments where a verse or a phrase or a scene hits me in a way that feels aimed at my heart, at my soul.</p>

        <p>Call it coincidence. Call it intuition. Call it fate.</p>

        <p>But I've lived enough life to know that God has a way of speaking through the things we think we choose. Through movies. Through books. Through songs. Through strangers. Through family. Through memories. Through grief. Through love. Through stories that aren't even ours.</p>

        <p>And if you're not paying attention, you'll miss it.</p>

        <p>That's one of the reasons I wrote <em>Life Lessons of a Man-Child</em>. Not to preach. Not to impress anyone. Not to make a name for myself. But to honor the small moments God used to shape me. To show the places where He spoke even when I wasn't listening. To show that even a man who hides behind humor and nostalgia can find his way back to faith.</p>

        <p>And maybe you're like me. Maybe you've had moments you brushed off. Maybe you've felt something tug at you but figured you imagined it. Maybe you've looked at your life and wondered if God ever noticed you at all.</p>

        <p>Let me tell you something I had to learn the hard way. He notices. He always has. The question is whether we notice Him back.</p>

        <p>I think the reason <em>The Ultimate Gift</em> hit me so hard wasn't because it mirrored my book, but because it mirrored the way God works: quietly, persistently, through people and moments and little nudges that don't make sense until you look backward and suddenly they do.</p>

        <p>God doesn't need lightning bolts to get your attention. Sometimes He just needs timing. Sometimes He just needs your heart open enough to see what's right in front of you.</p>

        <p>So here's what I believe now, more than ever:</p>

        <p>Some things aren't coincidences.</p>

        <p>Some moments aren't accidents.</p>

        <p>Some gifts aren't wrapped until you're ready to unwrap them.</p>

        <p>And when you finally do, they feel less like surprises and more like reminders. Like someone saying, with surprising gentleness, "I've been here the whole time."</p>

        <p>I don't know what's ahead for me with this book. I don't know who will read it or what they'll take from it. But I do know this: on the day I handed my manuscript to its designer, my dad handed me a movie that felt like an Amazon 5-star review. A validation. A holy echo.</p>

        <p>A gift I didn't know I needed.</p>

        <p>Maybe that's the real ultimate gift.</p>

        <p>And maybe we all can find the courage to believe it.</p>
